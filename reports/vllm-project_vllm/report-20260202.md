*   **ARM/CPU:** Added **ARM BF16 cross-compilation** support (#33079) and CPU core pinning logic to improve throughput (#33222).

### **4. V1 Engine & Core Infrastructure**
Developments in the "V1" engine architecture are focused on stability and feature parity with the original engine.
*   **Scheduler:** Fixed First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) queue ordering bugs (#33522) and implemented "skipping" for KV-blocked requests to prevent Head-of-Line blocking (#33499).
*   **Prefix Caching:** Fixes for prefix cache hit rate calculations in hybrid models (#33524) and optimizations for Sliding Window Attention (SWA) (#33125).
*   **KV Connector:** Improvements to the **NixlConnector** for disaggregated prefill/decode and cross-layer KV cache layout support (#33339, #33552).

### **5. Frontend, API & Tooling**
User-facing interfaces saw significant updates to match OpenAI’s evolving API.
*   **Realtime API:** Introduction of a **Websocket-based Realtime API** for speech-to-text (#33187).
*   **Responses API:** Enhancements to the `/v1/responses` endpoint, including reasoning token counting for models like DeepSeek R1 (#33513) and structured output support (#33249).
*   **Tool Calling:** Fixes for the **Harmony (GPT-OSS)** parser to handle streaming tool calls and multi-turn logic (#33520, #33306).
*   **Observability:** Implementation of **Journey Tracing** and OpenTelemetry spans to monitor request lifecycles from API to Engine (#33182, #33136).
