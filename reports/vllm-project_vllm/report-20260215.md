*   **KV Connector Optimizations:**
    *   Enabled uniform KV cache allocation for multi-group Hybrid Mixed Attention (HMA) models, allowing contiguous cross-layer layouts for efficient transfers [PR#34373](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34373).
    *   Introduced `NixlConnectorWithAux` to transfer full-prefix hidden states for EAGLE3 warm-up in P/D disaggregated setups [PR#34388](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34388).

### 3. Performance & Specialized Kernels
*   **NVIDIA Blackwell (SM100):** Integrated SGLang’s SM100 expert-specialization MXFP8 block-scaled grouped GEMM and quantization kernels [PR#34448](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34448).

    *   Exposed `mnnvl` backend for All-Reduce, optimized for multi-node NVLink clusters [PR#34109](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34109).
*   **Grouped Top-K:** Ported optimized grouped top-k kernels for small expert counts (≤512), significantly improving TTFT for DeepSeek and Nemotron architectures [PR#34206](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34206).
*   **CPU Acceleration:** Enabled VXE optimized GEMM kernels for s390x, improving paged attention throughput on IBM Z hardware [PR#34434](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34434).

### 4. Frontend & Serving
*   **`vllm online` Command:** New CLI entry point for running the API server without GPU resources, exposing stand-alone tokenization and chat template rendering via the `/render` endpoint [PR#34551](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34551).
*   **Streaming Control:** Added per-request `stream_interval_ms` to sampling parameters, allowing time-based throttling of token emission for lower client overhead [PR#34191](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34191).
*   **Generative Scoring:** Integrated next-token probability computation into `/v1/score`, supporting native CausalLM architectures for reranking tasks [PR#34539](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34539).
*   **Whisper Improvements:** Implemented automatic language detection via single-token generation with `<|startoftranscript|>` and fixed segment timestamp drift in long audio chunking [PR#34366](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34366), [PR#34310](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34310).

### 5. Bug Fixes & Stability
*   **Memory Leak:** Fixed a critical reference cycle leak in `Request` objects where `mm_features` (multimodal data) were pinned in CPU memory during prefix caching [PR#34183](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34183).
*   **Mamba/GDN:** Added validation to ensure `block_size <= max_num_batched_tokens` in Mamba align mode to prevent engine hangs [PR#34445](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34445) and fixed illegal memory access in `fused_recurrent` kernels [PR#34306](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34306).
*   **Distributed Stability:** Fixed NCCL collective size mismatches caused by non-deterministic file sorting in `fastsafetensors_weights_iterator` [PR#34190](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34190).
*   **Structured Output:** Fixed a bug where reasoning parsers falsely matched channel markers from previous turns in multi-turn `gpt-oss` conversations [PR#34454](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34454).
