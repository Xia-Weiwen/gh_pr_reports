# AI Analysis of Pull Requests for pytorch/ao during 20260126-20260202

Based on the 66 pull requests provided, here is a brief report of the recent activity in `pytorch/ao` categorized by their primary focus and components.

### 1. Documentation & Developer Experience
There has been a massive effort (led by `vkuzo`) to migrate documentation from GitHub `README.md` files into the official documentation site.
*   **Key Changes:** Moving Float8 training, QAT, and quantization READMEs to formal docs; reorganizing the "Workflows" landing page by hardware platform; and cleaning up API references.
*   **Goal:** Improve discoverability and professionalize the library's documentation structure.

### 2. Float8 Training & Inference (Hopper/Blackwell)
Significant focus on NVIDIA’s latest architectures, particularly around the use of `F.scaled_mm`.
*   **Hardware Specifics:** PR #3786 introduces logic to avoid specific MSLK kernels on **NVIDIA B200/GB200** for per-tensor scaled weights to prevent slowdowns.
*   **Fused Kernels:** Several PRs (#3781, #3780, #3779, #3732) add prototype fused kernels combining **RoPE (Rotary Positional Embeddings), Hadamard transforms, and FP8 quantization** for SDPA (Scaled Dot Product Attention) inference, specifically targeting models like Flux.
*   **AOTI Support:** Fixes for `dequantize_affine_float8` to support AOT Inductor (AOTI).

### 3. MXFP8 and MoE (Mixture of Experts) Training
A large stack of PRs (led by `danielvegamyhre`) focuses on **MXFP8** (Microscaling Formats) for training Mixture of Experts models.
*   **Emulated Mode:** PR #3724 adds an emulated mode for MXFP8 training, allowing developers to test these workflows on non-SM100 (Blackwell) hardware.
*   **Expert Parallel (EP):** Updates to the pipeline for Expert Parallel training and specific Grouped MatMul (GMM) configurations for MXFP8.

### 4. Hardware-Specific Support (XPU, X86, Metal)
*   **Intel XPU:** PR #3782 (relanded) enables INT8 quantization on Intel GPUs (e.g., Arc B580) using XMX intrinsics.
*   **X86:** Improvements to Smooth Quant patterns and Inductor test cases for CPU.
*   **Metal (Apple):** PR #3745 enables bias support in low-bit quantized linear kernels for macOS/Metal devices.

### 5. API Stability, Deprecation, and Cleanup
The repository is undergoing significant "housekeeping":
*   **Deprecations:** `torchao.autoquant` is now deprecated (#3741). The old, unmaintained GPTQ implementation was removed (#3720) in favor of a new prototype. Legacy sparse kernels like `activation24` (#3744) and `tensor_core_tiled_layout` (#3722) were deleted.
*   **ABI Stability:** Ongoing work to make kernels (like `sparse_cutlass`) ABI stable to support better integration with AOT Inductor.
*   **Torch Versions:** Support for **Torch 2.10** was added, while support for **Torch 2.7** was dropped (#3736).
