### 1. Hardware-Specific Backend Support
A significant portion of recent PRs focuses on expanding and optimizing SGLang across diverse hardware architectures:

*   **NVIDIA (Hopper/Blackwell):** Focus on FlashAttention-4 (FA4) paged KV support for SM90 (#18442), MXFP8/NVFP4 quantization via ModelOpt (#18449, #18224), and Piecewise CUDA Graph support for MoE layers (#18184).
*   **AMD (ROCm):** Massive updates to the **Aiter** and **MoRI** backends. This includes low-latency inter-node kernels (#18437), online FP8 to MXFP4 requantization (#18182), and kernel optimizations for DeepSeek/Kimi models (#18451, #18218).
*   **Huawei (Ascend NPU):** Introduction of DFlash speculative decoding (#18343), NPU-specific profiling (#18117), and fixes for RadixCache/DeepEP on Ascend devices (#18200, #18114).
*   **Intel (XPU):** Enabling DeepSeek-R1 inference with FP8 precision through Triton kernels (#18461).
*   **Moore Threads (MUSA):** Adding GGUF support for MUSA and fixing platform-specific regressions (#18357, #18456).

### 2. Model Support and Quantization
*   **DeepSeek & Kimi:** Extensive work to support **DeepSeek-V3.2/R1** and **Kimi-K2.5**, particularly in NVFP4/NVFP8 formats (#18370, #18389, #18412).
*   **New Architectures:** Support for **MiniCPM-o 4.5** (multimodal live streaming), **Qwen3-TTS** (Text-to-Speech), and initial onboarding for **voyage-4-nano** (#18420, #18183, #18436).
*   **Quantization Improvements:** Integration of Intel's **AutoRound** for unified INT8 quantization (#18139) and speeding up MXFP8 GEMM via cuBLAS (#18326).

### 3. SGLang Runtime (SRT) & Advanced Features
*   **PD Disaggregation:** Optimizing KV cache transfer for different TP sizes (#18163, #18158) and reusing initialized transfer engines in the Mooncake store (#18460).
*   **Speculative Decoding:** Reducing JIT overhead in Triton kernels by using fixed step sizes (#18244), adding multi-arm bandit strategy selection for EAGLE (#18284), and multi-layer EAGLE3 support (#18112).
*   **Core Engine:** Refactoring the RadixTree for pre/post-processing (#18147) and adding custom status codes for scheduler aborts (#18435).

### 4. Multi-modal and Diffusion (SGLang-D)
*   **Diffusion Engine:** Parallel VAE encoding for Wan models (#18179), layerwise offloading for MOVA (#18272), and supporting video generation direct-to-server to avoid tensor transfer overhead (#18253).
*   **VLM Configs:** Fixing `--mm-process-config` across all Vision-Language Models to allow per-modality routing (images vs. video) without parameter collisions (#18467).

### 5. Documentation and Infrastructure
*   **Documentation:** Consolidating diffusion docs (#18095), adding "redirect stubs" to the new SGL-Cookbook (#18432), and providing best practice guides for DP/DPA/SMG (#18096).
*   **CI/CD:** Fixing cross-container HuggingFace download races (#18328) and pre-caching models to reduce CI time (#18331).
